QUESTION 1.

I expect 1, 2, 2, 3.
#uniq does not mutate, so the numbers variable still points to the original array.

QUESTION 2.

! (the bang operator) is used to denote mutating methods, and to cause objects,
like, for example, booleans, to return the opposite value.
? is used in methods to check if the argument returns true or false after being
passed into the method.

!= means "not equal do", and is used in comparisons (i.e. x != y)
! before something turns object into opposite of its boolean equivalent
! after something is part of a method name (usually means method mutates caller)
? before something is used in ternary operator (? :)
? after something is part of a method name (usually checks truthiness of method caller)
!! before something turns object into its boolean equivalent

QUESTION 3.

advice.gsub!("important", "urgent")

QUESTION 4.

numbers.delete_at(1) => deletes the object at array index [1] (in this case, 2)
numbers.delete(1) => deletes the object 1, wherever it is in the array.
